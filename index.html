    <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            Starting my career as a recruiter has ignited a passion within me. Recruiting talent,
            understanding what they like, and finally placing them in suitable positions - it holds
            a special meaning for me to see these talents grow and thrive.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the other hand, I'm someone who enjoys exploring and learning new things. Like 
            suddenly getting the idea to create a website. But what's important is that I will
            strive to excel and deliver satisfying results wherever I am placed.
